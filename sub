hey my name is Josh Redd and I want to

show you a brand new way of building a

notion a totally new method that I'm

calling the perspectives method

[Music]

and this method will allow you to build

real applications in notion not just use

notion as the tool itself but we will be

able to build applications inside of it

things like task management content

management customer relations personal

Knowledge Management we are able to now

because of some new features and notion

build applications that you can interact

with the same way that you would

interact with applications on your phone

we're free to now build anything we want

without worrying about our data being

attached to it and wondering what's

going to happen if we delete it we can

forget all of that because now we can

build applications using the data that

you already have in place you can do

this without having to download a

template for me without having to change

the way your databases work you can

start right now without having to change

any of your data this is only possible

because of some new features that notion

has released in the recent past the main

one being the default template feature

when you create a new entry in a data

base the template is automatically

applied to the entry so it allows for a

very focused perspective on your work

and the flexibility to create New

Perspectives very very easily I don't

say that it's a system explicitly

because you can build this on top of any

system that you use this is just a

method for building a notion but it

doesn't replace any other system that

you might use I think that this actually

complements some of the systems that are

popular today in notion but this is

fundamentally a method more than it is a

system and so I actually love that

because it means that you can use this

without replacing the systems that you

already have in place so this is really

an opportunity to upgrade your notion

workspace and I do have my own take on

this method that I'm calling the strike

system which is really just my own label

using this perspectives method that I

will show you a little bit in this video

as I showcase what this perspective's

method is about but also in a future

video I will show you more in depth of

what the strike task system looks like

for me which is my task management but

then also how it plays out in other

applications like a CRM or a PKM that'll

be for a future video but for this video

I want to just introduce this method for

building and show you what's now

possible to notice that I'm really

excited about so let's get into it okay

so before I show you how to build and

use the perspectives method be a good

idea to show you what it actually is and

why it's why it's useful so this is my

home base I call the terminal this might

be like a command center or an HQ for

you this is a terminal and as you can

see it's really centered around

application this would be my personal

dashboard strike OS these are the names

of the application but they're links if

you're Savvy with notion you realize

that these are links to Pages these

Pages exist inside what I would call a

pack and these are pretty particular

pages but they're also the name of the

app so for example strike task which is

my task management system this is a link

to a page inside this database which is

the strike task app so let me open it up

and you'll see what I mean these are

different perspectives in the

application that I'm calling strike task

you can call yours whatever you want

this is just the name of my task

management application so what we've

done here is separated the application

from the information these are just

different views of your data so if I

back up real quick you will see in my

home base my terminal I have all of my

applications here as well as a template

for creating a new one which is what

we're going to walk through here in a

minute but then I've got my actual data

here so these are all the actual

databases and you'll notice that they

don't relate to anything in these

applications which is what makes this so

flexible in my task management as you

can see there's a page right here called

strike task so this is the link what I

would consider the app the whole thing

is the app but we need one page that we

consider the main page to go into the

app so as I develop a list of all my

applications I have this one called

track desk so when I click it I will go

into that page that I just showed you in

that pack and so I'm showing you a

template version so you don't have to

see all my personal information but this

is the same exact setup that I use

personally so this is the strike task

application and over on the left side

this is the meet and Bones of what makes

this so powerful we've got this

perspectives bar on the left and there's

basically a navigation bar if you're

tracking with me you'll notice that

these perspectives are just a list view

of a database and that database is the

application that I showed you called

strike task so we've got these

perspectives that are all just pages

in this database

so if I go back you'll see all of these

lined up here and this is what makes

this so easy to navigate in so for task

management we're coming straight to this

strike task page where we're going to be

met with my task list but then we can

see a few different views that I might

filter those tasks by Maybe by Within

week or by project I'm not going to get

into too much detail about how my task

manager works I'll save that for another

video this is kind of the main page that

we go into when we use this application

or perspectives method and you can see

that if I click over here into the inbox

we've got a more inbox type view where

you can create new tasks and enter them

into your task manager system and then

we click on another one called projects

in this case I've got it set up in a

board view based on type but you can you

can create this however you want and

then if any of the projects need more

information I have a quick review to

come in here and add some more

information like tag or information or

duration reviewing Etc as I navigate

through these Pages I've always got this

bar on the left side this is my

perspectives basically a navigation bar

instead of what you might expect out of

a website where the navigation is

horizontal across the top of the website

we're going to take advantage of the way

notion more intuitively works with

databases where each entry is a row in a

database and so obviously as you add new

ones it goes lower so it kind of works

more in a vertical fashion rather than a

horizontal fashion the way that works

best in notion is by putting it on a

list in a column on your pages so each

of these perspectives actually contains

a linked database to the perspectives

database that it lives in and it's on

the left side so every page will have

this and when we go into the template

you can see that I I'm using A New

Perspective template and inside that

template

is this linked database to the

application or basically to the list of

perspectives so every time you add a new

one it's automatically going to create a

new perspective in that database which

is then going to show up in every

perspective if you create a linked

database to that database it is really

simple in concept and you just have to

include it in the templates now what

makes this so powerful is the fact as I

mentioned earlier that we are able to

use the default template feature now

available in notion in this template

menu for the perspectives list we now

have this default option so what this

means is that every time I press this

new button down here and create a new

perspective it's automatically going to

apply this template and so what that

means is that we can create New

Perspectives on the Fly knowing that it

will automatically create this page

which includes the very essential

perspective navigation bar on the left

side in my case it's on the left you can

put it on the right if you want but

every time I create a new perspective

it's going to include this Dynamic

navigation this is the the fundamentals

of why this is able to work is the

default template and so we can see

different perspectives that I can go to

in this case I might want to see my tags

my task manager I've got a calendar view

and maybe somebody who is familiar with

an old app called OmniFocus just go

check figured that this is the name of a

perspective in OmniFocus and yes this is

very inspired by OmniFocus that's where

I got the inspiration for doing this and

they have a calendar perspective called

forecast that I definitely wanted to

give a shout out to with this

perspective so that's where this comes

from we've got flagged so if I flag a

task or even a project it's going to

show up in this perspective but at the

core of this method is the fact that I

have designed these perspectives in a

way that is minimal and what I would

actually call Atomic and what I mean by

atomic is that each perspective kind of

focuses on one thing it focuses on one

process that you go through or one

visual of the application that you want

to focus on so we keep this very minimal

and in this flagged perspective we're

obviously just wanting to look at

flagged tasks and flagged projects and

you can see if I come back to the main

page I actually have the flagged column

right here it's hard to tell because I

keep it skinny but if I flag something

like mow the lawn which is actually a

recurring task and I'll get to that in

another video and I come too flagged

you'll see molon so maybe you might use

this for like a big three if you do

daily big threes or weekly big threes

for projects whatever that looks like

for you the point is not that you can

make a flagged perspective the point is

that you can make any perspective that

you want and you have a very focused

intentional perspective that you use for

each piece of your application so in a

CRM that might look like your

opportunities that you go through you

know as you move an opportunity from a

cold to a warm to a hot lead to a close

to lead that would be one perspective

whereas maybe a list of your meetings

might be another perspective that you

would use it really is up to you and

you're not limited by the page structure

or the way you have your dashboard

structured because nothing is related so

you can create as many as you want so

for example I can just press new

and in my task manager maybe the way I

have it set up maybe I want to see

client tasks so if I have a system that

is incorporating client tasks and I have

some way of filtering in client tasks

maybe using the tags I could create a

perspective that just shows me tasks

with the client tag applied so in this

perspective we pulled in the tasks

database

and you know after we clean it up maybe

we want to filter by tag is

business client we've already got a tag

for it and in that sense we've

essentially created a perspective just

to see client tasks so in this case my

process might have been using the tag

business client but for your case that

might be something totally different it

might be where a task is related to a

project that is related to a client and

therefore you know that it's a client

task it's not limited so I'm not telling

you how to set up your system on the

back end I'm giving you a front-end

method for building real applications

and notion so that's just a quick kind

of dirty example of how you might Create

A New Perspective for client tasks but

again this is flexible and you can make

whatever you want so then you'll also

notice that this was created towards the

bottom of this list and I actually like

to keep my settings at the bottom but in

any case this might get kind of jumbled

so instead of having to manually

readjust every single perspective when

you make it I've developed a quick way

to reorder and make sure that you have

all of your perspectives in the right

order and in the same order for every

perspective that you have and that's

included in the template that we're

going to make so that you can just

reorder very quickly and easily so as

you can see this new client tasks

perspective was created and is sitting

at the bottom but you can see the sort

order column and this is essentially

just a quick way to reorder things and

that's because every single perspectives

navigation bar

has a filter and a sort every time I

create a new perspective it's already

included in the template so this filter

is applied and the sort is applied and

as we make this application template for

you so that you can make your own we'll

make sure to include this so that it's

already there when you make a New

Perspective so the filter is hide and

list is unchecked which you can see the

hide and list column right here

basically this is just a safety net in

case you want to experiment with

perspectives or you want to save one as

a draft but you don't want it to show up

in the list just yet you can check this

box and hide it and it just won't show

up in the list anymore but it still

exists in the actual application and you

can come into the settings and unhide it

as well as the sort which we can see

right here is sort order ascending so

every perspective has this linked

database to the perspectives or the

application and they all have that

filter applied and that's sort applied

and that makes it really easy to to

reorder these perspectives and in my

case I want my settings to be at the

very bottom and what I'll do is manually

reorder this perspectives manager that

is included in all the settings

perspectives that I have across all my

apps it's just a standard way of

building this application and what I'll

do is once I'm satisfied reordering

these and if I just mix it up just to

really show off what I'm doing here you

can see this is all out of order it

hasn't done anything here yet because I

haven't changed any of the numbers but

what I'll do is just come to the top one

press one and then enter to enter three

enter and so on

until I get to the very bottom and now

that I've changed the sort order on the

kind of the back end of this application

this is really the only backend that's

involved it will automatically change

the order that these show in and so

every perspective that I have will now

have an updated sort order for all the

other perspectives and my settings is at

the bottom so I like to include the

settings in all my applications really

specifically for that use but also any

kind of back end work that you need to

do on an application if it's applicable

when we do create a new application

especially the template for creating

them we will include just the main page

and the settings page so let me show you

what that looks like

in my dashboards and you can see all my

applications that I have so far here as

well as some more just um quality of

life applications where this is actually

more of a dashboard for me personally as

well as one that's made specifically for

my phone you're not limited just keeping

one perspective in one application and

not being able to see it anywhere else

you can mix and match these perspectives

across many different apps so in the

case of my task management I can see my

tasks but even in my CRM as I deal with

clients I'm also able to see their tasks

in my CRM so that's the beauty of this

approach is that again we're separating

the application layer from the

information layer and so we're able to

do and create different views of our

information without having to create

structure we don't rely on structure for

this we just pull in views of the

structure and as you can see down here

I've got all my different apps and then

I have this template so when I make a

new application I've made it easy for

myself to just create one from scratch

without having to go through all the

setup again and if we open up this

template and we go to the actual

database that we will be duplicating

every time we press this button I'll

show you what comes in the template

which is what I will show you how to

build and essentially just comes with

two things it comes with the app which

is just one of the perspectives and

settings and that settings as I just

showed you gives you a quick way of

reordering your perspectives or hiding

them just kind of quality of life things

to make this a lot easier to use and

then you have to make sure that the New

Perspective is set to default currently

there is a I don't know if it's a bug or

not an ocean but when you do duplicate

any databases this default does not

carry across so if I actually duplicate

this template or this application using

the template button what will happen is

this empty page will be set as the

default instead of the perspective that

I want so that's something to keep in

mind that may change in the near future

I'm not sure but for now we need to make

sure that every time you duplicate it

especially if you duplicate a template

from me or you make a new app you'll

have to make sure that you change the

default to the New Perspective but this

is really simple setup that you will

have every time you create a new one and

I want to make sure that we cover this

concept of the application main link or

main page being within the database and

I think this was the big shift that made

this kind of open up to me when you

typically create dashboards in notion

and a lot of the templates in fact all

the templates that we've seen up until

this point have been a page that you

then have to go into sub Pages or you

have to relate other pages to or you

have to create navigation bars but

essentially to create this user

experience you either have to lock

somebody into the way you've built it or

you have to build in relations that are

filtered and self-referenced in

templates which is is fine it works but

in this sense we are now completely

untethered from that approach because

all we have to do is view one of the

pages in this database as the main page

or the main application it's basically

the landing page of the application that

then gives you navigation access into

the other perspectives so that's a lot

of words what do I mean by that this

page that you land on if you see on my

main page instead of opening up this

database into my task management and

then choosing one of the pages I've just

designated one page out of every one of

my applications as the main landing page

so when I do click that as I've already

shown you it goes to the first page of

my task management which is just a

simple list of my tasks and then I can

go further into some of my other

perspectives and I think that's a great

approach for all of the applications you

just create a landing page or as you

create new

applications use the main perspective as

kind of your landing page and then build

other perspectives around that all

you'll have to do is copy the link and

then paste that anywhere in your

workspace and then you have a quick

access link to your app and this is

great because it also means that you can

keep your applications in the same place

that you keep your database or all of

your vaults which is a great way to

build out your workspace to keep all of

your databases in one spot and then use

that link anywhere in your workspace in

a personal dashboard or elsewhere to

give quick access to your application

without housing the actual database

somewhere besides where all the other

databases are kept we keep them all in

one spot which you can see down here

I've got my applications right here and

my database is right here and then if

you're curious I keep a synced block to

all of my other applications right here

and in my workspace I actually include

this synced block beneath the

perspectives list inside each app I do

that through the template so I don't

have to do that every time so that even

inside my applications I have a quick

link to other applications so I have the

main list of all the perspectives in

that application and then a quick link

to all my other applications and I house

it in a synced block so that I can

update that easily whenever I add or

remove applications in my workspace so

you can see I has everything here

and when we create a new one we'll let

it duplicate and then you can see this

is kind of the template of the

application you know we'll call this

strike YouTube

I don't know what kind of application

that would be maybe content creation and

then the step that you really need to

make sure you don't forget is to set

this new perspective as default and for

all views so that no matter what it will

always use this perspective

and then the last thing you'd want to do

is copy this link

come back to your main page and just

paste it wherever you want in your

workspace to give yourself quick access

so we just created that out of a

template and I click this link

and I'm already going to the main page

that I've created where I have my

perspectives list here and again as I

mentioned I have a sync block to all my

other applications here so I have quick

access to get out of this application

and then a space keeper as far as these

two columns usually I don't use this

menu column but in some cases it

actually it's really useful but I keep

it here just as a design template but

I'll usually delete this and then just

use this one mainspace for a linked view

of a database and I would recommend not

stacking your databases vertically if

you create a perspective I would really

suggest just using one linked database

but with multiple tabs if if that's

useful but don't stack them because as

you make more databases they will

typically start building down vertically

and so that's just going to push your

information further down in some cases

it would make sense and I can see how

you might find it useful to have maybe

just a bar across the top so I'm not

telling you that you have to do it only

this way but just as a general design

principle I prefer to only keep my

perspectives really simple really Atomic

and not stack my databases vertically so

that I'm looking at most of my

information if not all of it in one

glance an example of where this menu

view might come in handy if we go back

to the task manager you can see that if

I go to the forecast perspective I'm

making use of this smaller Slimmer

column right here I'm essentially

stealing some space from the main view

for this smaller column and what this

does is this is actually filtered where

I have a task that does not have a due

date assigned to it it's active and it

doesn't have a due date and so I put it

right next to the calendar because it

makes it very easy to take this task

instead of finding it in the calendar

view to just drag it over to the

calendar and because it was given a due

date it no longer fits the filter

criteria for this so it disappears and

then obviously it shows up on the

calendar view here so I love using that

menu column design feature right here

here's another example of using the menu

column where when I create a task it

stays in the inbox until I assign it a

project but because we can't filter the

project relation to only show us active

projects at least not yet I want to give

myself a quick glance at all of my

active projects so that I can just look

over here see what projects I have

currently active and then assign it to

the task instead of having to search

through the actual relation picker on

this menu here you can see another

version of using the menu column so I

guess I do use this quite a bit in my

task manager here I am using it for

projects on the left and tasks on the

right

but here you can see I'm just using this

one database to take up this whole

entire View and I think that this should

be your default unless you have a good

reason to use that menu column so don't

feel like you always have to fill out

all of your page with tons of different

databases in fact I think that's why

this perspectives method works really

well because it allows you to actually

have very focused perspectives on your

work instead of having to pile

everything into dashboards which is very

common these days and a lot of the

templates that you see so instead of

doing that we make this very Atomic okay

so how do we actually build this I want

to show you step by step starting from

scratch how we do this so if you are not

as Savvy as some where you can just pick

up everything I just did by watching I'm

going to literally take you step by step

from scratch and show you how to build

out this system because honestly it's

really simple and I want to make this as

easy as possible for you to use we'll

just call this our HQ page

create a page I like to start from a

page

and then create my database by clicking

this table

in the new database

and I like to delete these and the tags

column

and we will call this

Strike App

so instead of making the app up front

and then every time you want to make

another app you have to do this from

scratch we're going to make the template

so that all you have to do is press one

button and you'll be able to make as

many apps as your heart desires we're

not going to build a task management per

se but we're going to build the template

so that you can make whatever

application you want so we'll call this

Strike App pack

and then we're going to start with just

two of these perspectives these will

turn into perspectives but there'll be

two and we want to make sure that we use

the default template when we make them

so before we make them which will be the

strike app and settings let's go into

the template

menu create a new template and call it

New Perspective

and we'll add an icon we'll use a light

bulb so blue light bulb New Perspective

I like to come over and uh customize the

page

turn these off

Go full width small text small text is

up to you but definitely need full width

and just in case it seems like your

notion looks way more packed or

congested you can easily zoom in and out

using command minus or command plus on

Mac and control I believe on Windows I

haven't used windows in a long time

minus and plus but I like to zoom mine

out a fair bit so that I have more real

estate to work with and this is going to

be really essential with the

perspectives because it does use a

sliver on the side of your workspace so

it's going to take up some space but

realistically if you do end up using

this method across your entire workspace

you don't need to use the sidebar and I

have never used a sidebar at least not

in my normal use of notion since the

beginning because I feel like you should

be able to build notion in a way that

interacts much like a website it should

be very intuitive and interactive in the

way that you get around so that's why I

think that this navigation bar on the

left side of each perspective effective

really just eliminates the need for the

sidebar create the system that works for

you so that you can just get around

however you need and not have to go more

to this what I would consider back end

especially as team spaces get rolled out

that just becomes more of a back-end

feature of notion rather than a way of

getting around notion we're going to

need three columns so slash dol3

and then I like to put a little letter

to make sure I know where they're at

this left column will be the

perspectives as you've already seen

we'll slide this over because it's going

to be fairly skinny

and then we will slide this over

and keep this one skinny as well

so as placeholders

just so you can see this is perspectives

this is the what I call the menu and

this is the main and this is more of a

design layout that you can obviously

adjust but I like to have these pop up

every time I create a new perspective

and what we're going to do is actually

take a linked view of this

Strike App pack so you can do that by

just

copying this link or if you want to use

the Slash

CR you can pull up the link from there

if you search for it but I'm just going

to command V create linked view of

database and let's create a call out

block slash

call out we'll change this icon to an I

very appropriate for perspectives

call it perspectives I like to make it

bold

[Music]

and then when you press enter here it

just goes below the call out but if you

hold shift and then press enter you're

able to create some space in the callout

block and we're going to need that

because what we'll do here is I want to

hide this database title change this to

a

list

so change the layout to list

so here's another very important feature

that you need to make sure you get right

and is a another reason why this works

really well now whereas before this

would never worked without this feature

now we can open pages in side Peak but

also it gives us the ability to default

open pages in full page so that's what I

want to do especially in this template

so now whenever you click one of these

Pages it will automatically open up full

page in the past when you clicked on one

it would open up in a modal view or

Center Peak View is what it's called now

and then you'd have to press command

enter and open up the page full page so

it was just a lot of clicks to make this

happen whereas now because that's a

default option that gives us the ability

to use this list more as a navigation

bar so that's another feature that's

very critical to this method being able

to now work we have this linked view to

the database

and

we'll pull this up here inside the

actual call out

let's get rid of this extra space and so

now anytime A New Perspective is created

it will just automatically fill in there

so we're making this in the template

right now and now that we've kind of

built out the bones of this what we want

to do is come back to this app

and as you can see I created a new one

and it showed a blank I'm going to

command Z that now we can come over here

and change this template New Perspective

to default for All Views and now when I

create a new one it will apply all of

that that I just made in that template

starting off with the blue light bulb so

we'll call this Strike App

and then when we open this up

now we've got this starting to fill out

already let's go back

and we'll make one more called settings

let's change this icon

to a gear

okay and then before we move on too much

further what we want to do is create

those two columns that we sort and

filter by in every perspective so one of

them is a number and it's called sort

order and the other one is a check box

called hide from

list we want to go into these

perspectives

and make sure we filter

both so we want to make sure hide from

list is unchecked

and then we want to sort so this is a

good example of why you want to make

sure that you do this in the template

first so that you don't have to do this

for every perspective

so we'll save that so this main one was

now given the filter and sort right

there

we'll make sure we hide these always

hide don't want to see those

and then if we go to settings obviously

because I didn't do this beforehand I

now have to filter it

hide from list is unchecked

and

sort by sort order save for everyone

and last but not least we need to

actually make sure that we do this in

the template so that we don't have to do

that every time so if we go into the

template and we come into this

perspectives bar

filter hide from list unchecked

save

and sort by sort order save

now every time we create a new

perspective no matter where we're at

because it is using that default

template it will already have that

filter and sort applied so when we go to

the settings finally what we need to do

is pull in a linked view of this same

database but see it in a table view so

we will

paste that link so that we can create a

linked view of database

table

I always hide these

let's get rid of this placeholder

finally

we can

give these default values of one for the

main perspective and two first settings

so now that we've done that

if we come back to our HQ page we see

that we've made this Strike App pack

and I think the Final Touch should be

making this

a box icon okay so now that we've made

this template what we want to do is

again use a template but we're going to

use the template button and this button

allows you to essentially press a button

and whatever is contained inside it when

you configure it will then be duplicated

so that whole application that we made

which is a database itself drop this

inside the template button

call this

new app

pack I like to call them app packs

and close so wherever your HQ page was

now that you've created a template for

yourself you don't have to do that every

time you make an app you're set up to

just press this button

and all you have to do is make sure that

you don't forget because of the way

notion currently is don't forget to

come immediately into the application

that you just made go to the template

and click on this three dots next to the

New Perspective

that you made in the templates and set

it as default for All Views once you do

that no matter where you're at when you

create a new perspective it will apply

the template that you made for the app

if you follow that step by step you now

have the ability to create any kind of

app that you want and the ability to

quickly create New Perspectives so you

can see that if we come into this

page

we now have this Dynamic list going on

right here and if I create a new one it

will populate with that list as well as

it has included the New Perspective that

I just made New Perspective

and if I go back to the strike app the

main page you can see that it is

included in this list and you can see

that it was a little bit of out of order

because when you create a new page we're

not able to assign it a number yet so we

come to this sort order

and we readjust I like my settings at

the bottom

and then starting from the top we do one

enter two enter three enter and it

adjusts everything and if I were to

click hide from list on this new

perspective because maybe I don't like

it right now but I want to save it as a

draft it's now gone in any of these

perspectives because we've filtered

anything out that has that checked and

then what you would do is just create a

perspective and pull in any of the

databases that you use like projects or

tasks or notes whatever you want this is

completely separate from all of that and

so you can create perspectives and then

in the main kind of body page of each

perspective you can then create

workflows that work for you I like to

think in terms of what do you do in

notion you come to notion not to look at

projects necessarily but you come to

notion to do project management you come

to notion to manage your content or to

interact with your personal knowledge

you do all these different applications

so this is actually far more intuitive

than thinking in terms of buckets of

life or pillars of life even though

those things are useful in terms of

classifying what kind of information you

are working with is this information

part of this bucket or this pillar those

are useful but when you mix them with

the application layer it gets a little

confusing so now that we have this

separated you can still use those things

but now you have a completely separate

and higher level of application to work

with that data in a more intuitive way

so you approach notion now by thinking

what application do I need to use the

same way you would approach your phone

you get on your phone and you decide

what application you want to use you get

on Instagram you get on Twitter because

you want to do certain things you keep

your data in one place and then you make

your applications interact with that

data in different ways so that you can

process the information in different

ways using perspectives the final tip

that I want to give you is that in each

of your perspectives and this is

something that you would want to do in

the template it's self is create a block

to whatever your main pages that you

deal with so in this case we have this

HQ page

and what I want to do is

copy this link because I actually want

to come into this app so I'm going to go

into the app that we just made but then

we'll also want to do this to the

template we'll come into the app and

then on each of these perspectives

press enter on the right of the title

it's an easy way to get a block at the

very top of the page I want to make

another call out

and then grab it we don't want it to go

across the entire top but we want to

make it line up on the left side right

above the perspectives of the app

so now that we have this call out in

place we want to command V the link to

whatever main page that we want to give

ourselves access to wherever we're at so

our main HQ page in this case but

instead of using link to page if we do

link to page it's actually going to kick

it out of the call out or it's going to

force you to create some blank space at

the title of the call out

and what that looks like is this or this

I don't like that so let's go backwards

what we want to do is command V and

mention page and now we have this quick

access to our HQ page from this

perspective and we might actually change

the color

maybe purple for this one and then to

make it easy I actually want to

highlight this command C

on Mac and I'm going to go to my

settings perspective as well

and do the same thing here command V

and then I'm going to drag this right

above

so I had to do that because I didn't

include that in the template but now

we're going to go into the template for

our New Perspectives edit

and put that at the top of

the template so now no matter what when

I create a new perspective in the app I

will always have a quick way to get out

of the app and go back to my main page

sort of a home page if you will in terms

of your entire workspace whereas this

page would be the home page per the app

so I did that in the app that we created

so what I want to make sure I do is go

into the template

and make sure that I do that as well it

looks like I'm duplicating my effort and

I am because I'm kind of going

retroactively and doing this but if you

do this from the very beginning you

won't have to do any of this work twice

just put all this into the template that

you create and you won't have to worry

about it again

that should showcase to you why it's

important to set up this template the

correct way from the beginning so that

if you create let's say five

applications with 10 perspectives each

if you want to go in and make some major

change to your perspectives wholesale

unless you're working with a synced

block you will have to go into 50

perspectives and change it and then go

into your template and change that so

it's very important to get all this set

up from the very beginning so you don't

have to do this over and over so in this

case you can even see that I have an

icon that's a lightning bolt and I

probably would prefer something

different but if I want to change that

for all of my perspectives I need to go

into each perspective and change it so

it's very important that you get this

set up even aesthetically the way you

want from the very beginning in this

template button right here so that you

don't have to do it over and over as you

scale this approach in my system

this is a template that I just started

kind of putting together I haven't

actually done anything with this this is

how every application I use looks so in

this application which I'm making for

you know if somebody wants to write a

novel I have different perspectives like

notes characters places scenes just

different things that you might want to

use when you are writing a novel but

this is how my application looks but

then you can also see that I have a link

to my main page and this is on every

perspective and this is actually an

application itself this is not just a

typical HQ page this is actually an

application that's built the same way

with the perspectives list and it gives

me the ability to experiment with what

my HQ is going to look like and so that

gives me a lot of flexibility there but

then what I want to show you finally is

that under the perspectives box I have a

synced block including a call out to a

list of all of my other applications

that I want to give myself access to so

this original

if you want to implement this in your

workspace I would recommend it in case

you want to scale this approach so on my

main page my terminal page down at the

bottom I have my applications my

databases and then right here I just

have a quick link to my home page which

is not in a synced block but down here

this is an original synced block with

links to all of my applications they

don't live here they live over here but

these are just links to those main pages

in each one of these applications it

doesn't have all of them it just has the

ones that I want quick access to and I

can actually tell that I have 129

different perspectives across all of

these packs so if I update this it will

update across 129 instances and so this

is why sync to blocks are actually

really useful in some cases that's where

I get quick access to other applications

outside of whatever I'm working in

okay so that was an overview of the

perspectives method as well as a

walkthrough of how to build your own I'm

developing my own take on this that I'm

calling the strike system but that is

not to say that that's exclusive to this

method you can use this method that

we'll call the perspectives method and

you can use this without using anything

that I give you you don't have to

download any databases you don't have to

structure them in any way you can just

use this application method or this

perspectives method on the databases

that you already have so you don't have

to do anything you can just start

building and try it out for yourself and

then as you can see I've done it for

different applications that I use so

this is task management customer

relationship management for my clients

personal Knowledge Management for any

ideas and linking ideas content

management habit tracker my planner for

like daily weekly quarterly planning

finances just an example of building a

novel writing a novel building that out

more as a template but someday I'll

actually write a novel we'll see and

then this was the kind of more example

application that we made I don't

actually want that so we'll delete it

and I'm not losing anything because

nothing was in it so that's the beauty

of this approach you're not tied to it

like you are with many of the other

templates out there I love that this is

very minimal it's very focused and I

think it's very intuitive instead of

coming to a dashboard where you have to

think about what kind of area you're

trying to think about or what project or

what bucket think now in terms of what

will you do what do you need to do what

kind of process do you need to do and I

think that answer comes to mind a lot

quicker than sometimes when you're

trying to think about where this file

goes what it needs to attach to and

things like that so you can think about

any sort of application you might use

and create apps for that you can even

create them maybe not necessarily for a

specific process that you go through but

just a specific kind of dashboard that

you want to see so like I said I have my

own personal dashboard where my main

page we have just my planner pages so

day week month quarter year I can go

into those see my planner but then over

here I have different perspectives like

client operations or any notion

templates that I'm building I can keep

them in once space so they're actually

living in a database which is on the

back end but then I have a quick way to

get to notion templates I don't have an

application for notion templates because

really I just need a quick way to access

my different templates and then go into

those templates and work on those and so

I include those as a perspective in my

personal OS dashboard which is using

this same perspectives method as you can

see right here and then again quick

access to all of my other applications

and then at the very top since this is

my personal one it actually links to my

more back end page which I call the

terminal

and so that's it that is the

perspectives method in notion and this

gives you the ability to create any

number of perspectives and flexible

views of all of your data without

attaching your data to any of it so I

love this approach gives you quick

navigation and I hope that you will use

it and please share your builds with me

on Twitter at the Josh red show me what

you use I would love to see how you use

this approach I'm sure there's many more

examples of ways to use this that I'm

not thinking about so I would love to

see what you create and please subscribe

to this channel I will release a

comprehensive workspace called the

strike system or strike OS which will

include not only applications for every

area of life like the ones you've seen

on my terminal page like task management

and content management and Etc but also

the databases and the structuring that

goes on behind the scenes to make all of

that work seamlessly so definitely make

sure that you subscribe follow me on

Twitter and you'll be the first to know

about any of these things coming out

thanks for watching this video please

leave a comment let me know what you

think and I will see you in the next
